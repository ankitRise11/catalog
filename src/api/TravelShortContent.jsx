Vegas is just a boring and sad city. Everything just feels extremely FAKE. The fake glam...Everything and everyone is there for show, there is no genuine fun in this city, the shows are boring and old, food is sooooo expensive yet so average, I don\'t think I had a single meal I left feeling intrigued. And drinking and gambling just also so sad."},

I\\u2019m trying to figure out which island would be best for us. We really want to hike (we\\u2019re definitely not pros though so nothing too advanced lol), snorkel, and just be outside. If there was any cool outdoor tours that would be really fun too. We also are looking forward to good food. We don\\u2019t have a set budget and we\\u2019re willing to spend some money as we know Hawaii is expensive but we are still trying to be reasonable. We are all pretty young and have never been before so we want to make the most of it. I\\u2019ve read a lot about Oahu and Maui but I\\u2019m still not sure. What island do you think would be best for us to go to? Thank you!!"},
